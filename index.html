      <h2>Hiiiiiii Monkeyyyy</h2>
      <p>I love the way you care. It never feels forced and it always feels so deep.You care in the small ways, the quiet ways, the ways you probably don't even think of. And I love it, and I love you for it. </p>
      <p>I love when you ask me how I'm doing and what am I doing not as a task but because you care. I love the sotfness in your voice and your forehead kisses. I love how you notice when I'm upset and other little things about me. I love love love how you listen to me with your whole attention and respond with your opinion and make sure I take the right step. It's the fact that you check in with me without me asking for it, Your care means so much to me, the way you talk, the way you hug, the way you kiss, the way you remember. Just everything baby. 
</p>
      <p3>You never make me feel like I'm asking for too much, and I am so grateful that you are always ready to make me forget about my overthinking. You mean so much to me. You are SO SO SO SPECIAL to me and without you I wouldn't be the person I am rn. Thank you for everything.  
</p3>
	<h3>I love you baby. I win.</h3>
